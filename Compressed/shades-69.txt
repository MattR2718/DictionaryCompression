almost thought 024 ambitious young artist 009 022 time 021 022 New England hags had endeavored 054 delineate chaos bewitched But 043 dint 021 much 037 earnest contemplation 037 oft repeated ponderings 037 especially 043 throwing open 022 little window towards 022 back 021 022 014 006 061 last come 054 022 conclusion 001 such 062 idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted But what most puzzled 037 confounded 006 047 010 long limber portentous black mass 021 something hovering 009 022 centre 021 022 picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating 009 010 nameless yeast A boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough 054 drive 010 nervous man distracted Yet 047 there 010 sort 021 indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about 046 001 fairly froze 006 054 046 till 006 involuntarily took 062 oath 015 008 054 find out what 001 marvellous 033 meant Ever 037 anon 010 bright but alas deceptive idea would dart 006 through It s 022 Black Sea 009 010 midnight gale It s 022 unnatural combat 021 022 four primal elements It s 010 blasted heath It s 010 Hyperborean winter scene It s 022 breaking up 021 022 icebound stream 021 Time But last all these fancies yielded 054 001 020 portentous something 009 022 picture s midst That once 007 out 037 all 022 rest were plain But stop does 046 not bear 010 faint resemblance 054 010 gigantic fish even 022 great leviathan himself In fact 022 artist s design seemed this 010 final theory 021 my own partly based upon 022 aggregated opinions 021 many aged persons 015 whom I conversed upon 022 subject The picture represents 010 Cape Horner 009 010 great hurricane 022 half foundered ship weltering there 015 064 three dismantled masts alone visible 037 062 exasperated whale purposing 054 spring clean over 022 026 is 009 022 enormous act 021 impaling himself upon 022 three mast heads The opposite wall 021 this 014 047 029 all over 015 010 heathenish array 021 monstrous clubs 037 spears Some were thickly set 015 glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted 015 knots 021 human hair 037 020 047 sickle shaped 015 010 vast handle sweeping round like 022 segment made 009 022 new mown grass 043 010 long armed mower You shuddered as 006 gazed 037 wondered what monstrous cannibal 037 savage 058 ever have gone 010 death harvesting 015 such 010 hacking horrifying implement Mixed 015 these were rusty 016 whaling lances 037 harpoons all broken 037 deformed Some were storied weapons With this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between 010 sunrise 037 010 sunset And 001 harpoon 034 like 010 corkscrew now 047 flung 009 Javan seas 037 run away 015 043 010 whale years afterwards slain off 022 Cape 021 Blanco The original iron entered nigh 022 tail 037 like 010 restless needle sojourning 009 022 body 021 010 man travelled full forty feet 037 061 last 047 007 imbedded 009 022 hump Crossing this dusky 014 037 on through yon 012 arched 039 cut through what 009 016 times must have been 010 great central chimney 015 fireplaces all round 006 enter 022 public room A still duskier place is this 015 such 012 ponderous beams above 037 such 016 wrinkled planks beneath 001 006 would almost fancy 006 trod 024 016 026 s cockpits especially 021 such 010 howling night when this corner anchored 016 ark rocked 034 furiously 027 020 028 stood 010 long 012 shelf like table covered 015 cracked glass cases filled 015 dusty rarities gathered from this 011 world s remotest nooks Projecting from 022 further angle 021 022 room stands 010 dark looking den 022 bar 010 rude attempt 061 010 right whale s head Be 001 how 046 may there stands 022 vast arched bone 021 022 whale s jaw 034 011 010 coach might almost drive beneath 046 Within are shabby shelves ranged round 015 016 decanters bottles flasks 037 009 those jaws 021 swift destruction like another cursed Jonah 043 044 name indeed they called him bustles 010 little withered 016 man who for their money dearly sells 022 sailors deliriums 037 death Abominable are 022 tumblers into 044 he pours his poison Though true cylinders without within 022 villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards 054 010 cheating bottom Parallel meridians rudely pecked into 022 glass surround these footpads goblets Fill 054 this mark 037 your charge is but 010 penny 054 this 010 penny more 037 034 on 054 022 full glass 022 Cape Horn measure 044 006 may gulp down for 010 shilling Upon entering 022 place I 007 010 number 021 young seamen gathered about 010 table examining 043 010 dim light divers specimens 021 skrimshander I sought 022 landlord 037 telling him I desired 054 be accommodated 015 010 room received for answer 001 his house 047 full not 010 bed unoccupied But avast he added tapping his forehead 006 haint no objections 054 sharing 010 harpooneer s blanket have ye I s pose 006 are goin 010 whalin 034 006 d better get used 054 001 sort 021 thing I told him 001 I never liked 054 sleep two 009 010 bed 001 if I should ever do 034 046 would depend upon who 022 harpooneer might be 037 001 if he 022 landlord really had no other place for me 037 022 harpooneer 047 not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about 010 strange town on 034 bitter 010 night I would put up 015 022 half 021 059 decent man s blanket I thought 034 All right take 010 seat Supper 006 want supper Supper ll be ready directly I sat down on 062 016 wooden settle carved all over like 010 bench on 022 Battery At 020 end 010 ruminating tar 047 still further adorning 046 015 his jack knife stooping over 037 diligently working away 061 022 space between his legs He 047 trying his hand 061 010 ship under full sail but he didn t make much headway I thought At last 024 four or five 021 us were summoned 054 our meal 009 062 adjoining room It 047 cold as Iceland no fire 061 all 022 landlord said he couldn t afford 046 Nothing but two dismal tallow candles each 009 010 winding sheet We were fain 054 button up our monkey jackets 037 hold 054 our lips cups 021 scalding tea 015 our half frozen fingers But 022 fare 047 021 022 most substantial kind not 048 meat 037 potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper One young fellow 009 010 green box coat addressed himself 054 these dumplings 009 010 most direful manner My boy said 022 landlord 006 ll have 022 nightmare 054 010 dead sartainty Landlord I whispered 001 aint 022 harpooneer is 046 Oh no said he looking 010 sort 021 diabolically funny 022 harpooneer is 010 dark complexioned chap He never eats dumplings he don t he eats nothing but steaks 037 he likes em rare The devil he does says I Where is 001 harpooneer Is he here He ll be here afore long 047 022 answer I 058 not help 046 but I began 054 feel suspicious 021 this dark complexioned harpooneer At 059 rate I made up my mind 001 if 046 034 turned out 001 we should sleep together he must undress 037 get into bed before I did Supper over 022 company went back 054 022 bar room when knowing not what else 054 do 015 myself I resolved 054 spend 022 rest 021 022 evening as 010 looker on Presently 010 rioting noise 047 heard without Starting up 022 landlord cried That s 022 Grampus s crew I seed her reported 009 022 offing this morning 010 three years voyage 037 010 full ship Hurrah boys now we ll have 022 latest news from 022 Feegees A tramping 021 sea boots 047 heard 009 022 014 022 door 047 flung open 037 009 rolled 010 wild set 021 mariners enough Enveloped 009 their shaggy watch coats 037 015 their heads muffled 009 woollen comforters all bedarned 037 ragged 037 their beards stiff 015 icicles they seemed 062 eruption 021 bears from Labrador They had just landed from their boat 037 this 047 022 first house they entered No wonder then 001 they made 010 straight wake for 022 whale s mouth 022 bar when 022 wrinkled little 016 Jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round One complained 021 010 bad cold 009 his head upon 044 Jonah mixed him 010 pitch like potion 021 gin 037 molasses 044 he swore 047 010 sovereign cure for all colds 037 catarrhs whatsoever never mind 021 how long standing or whether caught off 022 coast 021 Labrador or on 022 weather 028 021 062 ice island The liquor soon mounted into their heads as 046 generally does even 015 022 arrantest topers newly landed from sea 037 they began capering about most obstreperously
