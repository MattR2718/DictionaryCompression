000 001 002 003 004 005 006 007 008 009 010 011 012 013 014 015 old fashioned wainscots reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft On one side hung 010 very large oil painting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced 001 009 the unequal crosslights by which 006 viewed it it was only by diligent study and 010 series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors 001 006 could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows 001 at first 006 almost thought some ambitious young artist 009 the time of the New England hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched But by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the 014 006 at last come to the conclusion 001 such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted But what most puzzled and confounded 006 was 010 long limber portentous black mass of something hovering 009 the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating 009 010 nameless yeast A boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive 010 nervous man distracted Yet was there 010 sort of indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about it 001 fairly froze 006 to it till 006 involuntarily took an oath 015 008 to find out what 001 marvellous painting meant Ever and anon 010 bright but alas deceptive idea would dart 006 through It s the Black Sea 009 010 midnight gale It s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements It s 010 blasted heath It s 010 Hyperborean winter scene It s the breaking up of the icebound stream of Time But last all these fancies yielded to 001 one portentous something 009 the picture s midst That once 007 out and all the rest were plain But stop does it not bear 010 faint resemblance to 010 gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself In fact the artist s design seemed this 010 final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons 015 whom I conversed upon the subject The picture represents 010 Cape Horner 009 010 great hurricane the half foundered ship weltering there 015 its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is 009 the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast heads The opposite wall of this 014 was hung all over 015 010 heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears Some were thickly set 015 glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted 015 knots of human hair and one was sickle shaped 015 010 vast handle sweeping round like the segment made 009 the new mown grass by 010 long armed mower You shuddered as 006 gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone 010 death harvesting 015 such 010 hacking horrifying implement Mixed 015 these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed Some were storied weapons With this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between 010 sunrise and 010 sunset And 001 harpoon so like 010 corkscrew now was flung 009 Javan seas and run away 015 by 010 whale years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco The original iron entered nigh the tail and like 010 restless needle sojourning 009 the body of 010 man travelled full forty feet and at last was 007 imbedded 009 the hump Crossing this dusky 014 and on through yon 012 arched way cut through what 009 old times must have been 010 great central chimney 015 fireplaces all round 006 enter the public room A still duskier place is this 015 such 012 ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath 001 006 would almost fancy 006 trod some old craft s cockpits especially of such 010 howling night when this corner anchored old ark rocked so furiously On one side stood 010 long 012 shelf like table covered 015 cracked glass cases filled 015 dusty rarities gathered from this 011 world s remotest nooks Projecting from the further angle of the room stands 010 dark looking den the bar 010 rude attempt at 010 right whale s head Be 001 how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whale s jaw so 011 010 coach might almost drive beneath it Within are shabby shelves ranged round 015 old decanters bottles flasks and 009 those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed Jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles 010 little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison Though true cylinders without within the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to 010 cheating bottom Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads goblets Fill to this mark and your charge is but 010 penny to this 010 penny more and so on to the full glass the Cape Horn measure which 006 may gulp down for 010 shilling Upon entering the place I 007 010 number of young seamen gathered about 010 table examining by 010 dim light divers specimens of skrimshander I sought the landlord and telling him I desired to be accommodated 015 010 room received for answer 001 his house was full not 010 bed unoccupied But avast he added tapping his forehead 006 haint no objections to sharing 010 harpooneer s blanket have ye I s pose 006 are goin 010 whalin so 006 d better get used to 001 sort of thing I told him 001 I never liked to sleep two 009 010 bed 001 if I should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and 001 if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about 010 strange town on so bitter 010 night I would put up 015 the half of any decent man s blanket I thought so All right take 010 seat Supper 006 want supper Supper ll be ready directly I sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like 010 bench on the Battery At one end 010 ruminating tar was still further adorning it 015 his jack knife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs He was trying his hand at 010 ship under full sail but he didn t make much headway I thought At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal 009 an adjoining room It was cold as Iceland no fire at all the landlord said he couldn t afford it Nothing but two dismal tallow candles each 009 010 winding sheet We were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea 015 our half frozen fingers But the fare was of the most substantial kind not only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper One young fellow 009 010 green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings 009 010 most direful manner My boy said the landlord 006 ll have the nightmare to 010 dead sartainty Landlord I whispered 001 aint the harpooneer is it Oh no said he looking 010 sort of diabolically funny the harpooneer is 010 dark complexioned chap He never eats dumplings he don t he eats nothing but steaks and he likes em rare The devil he does says I Where is 001 harpooneer Is he here He ll be here afore long was the answer I could not help it but I began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer At any rate I made up my mind 001 if it so turned out 001 we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before I did Supper over the company went back to the bar room when knowing not what else to do 015 myself I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as 010 looker on Presently 010 rioting noise was heard without Starting up the landlord cried That s the Grampus s crew I seed her reported 009 the offing this morning 010 three years voyage and 010 full ship Hurrah boys now we ll have the latest news from the Feegees A tramping of sea boots was heard 009 the 014 the door was flung open and 009 rolled 010 wild set of mariners enough Enveloped 009 their shaggy watch coats and 015 their heads muffled 009 woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff 015 icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador They had just landed from their boat and this was the first house they entered No wonder then 001 they made 010 straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when the wrinkled little old Jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round One complained of 010 bad cold 009 his head upon which Jonah mixed him 010 pitch like potion of gin and molasses which he swore was 010 sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of Labrador or on the weather side of an ice island The liquor soon mounted into their heads as it generally does even 015 the arrantest topers newly landed from sea and they began capering about most obstreperously
